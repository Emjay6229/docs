## How Nomba Checkout Works
In addition to its core functionality as a payment gateway, Nomba Checkout distinguishes itself by offering a robust API. This API empowers customers to build customized checkout payment links tailored to their specific needs. Businesses can leverage this feature to create a seamless and integrated payment experience for their customers. By utilizing the Nomba Checkout API, businesses gain the flexibility to adapt payment processes to their unique requirements, enhancing efficiency and providing a tailored payment solution for their customer base.

The process begins with authentication, followed by the generation of a checkout link, and concludes with payment acceptance and transaction verification. 

#### Authentication
The process kicks off with your app communicating with Nomba to generate an access token by making a `POST` call to `/auth/token/issue` ([Authentication](/nomba-api-reference/authenticate/obtain-access-token)). Upon successful authentication, the Nomba API will respond with a success message containing the access token.

#### Checkout Link Generation
Your app proceeds to generate a checkout link by making a `POST` call to `/checkout/order` ([Create checkout order](/nomba-api-reference/online-checkout/create-an-online-checkout-order)). The Nomba API responds with a success message containing the checkout link, which your app will display to the customer for them to make payment.

#### Payment Acceptance
The customer, using the checkout link, initiates the payment process, choosing to pay with a card or bank transfer.
Nomba sends a webhook notification to your app, signaling the completion of the payment.

#### Transaction Verification:

The Nomba API responds with a success message containing transaction details.

#### Payment Receipt
Your app sends a payment receipt to the customer, completing the payment process.
