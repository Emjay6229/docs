## Overview

Nomba Payment Terminal Service Provider (PTSP) facilitates the seamless processing of card transactions initiated from payment terminals. This involves a series of integration steps, each serving a vital role in ensuring secure and efficient transaction processing.


#### Parameter Download
This helps to obtain essential terminal parameters from the Nomba system. These parameters include crucial information such as terminalId, tmk, time, etc. These parameters play a critical role in synchronizing the terminal with the Nomba system. Specifically, the Terminal Master Key (TMK) is retrieved during this process while the Terminal Pin Key (TPK) is retrieved during the Key Exchange process.

#### Key Exchange
Interacting with the Key Exchange is essential for the correct execution of transaction processes. The Key Exchange process generates the Terminal Pin Key (TPK), which is then written into the PED. The cryptographic keys obtained through this process are integral for securing communication between the payment terminal and the Nomba system. It enhances the overall security posture of the transaction environment.

#### Card Transaction Initiation
Prior to commencing a card transaction, it is imperative to confirm the accurate embedding of cryptographic keys into the PED. To securely begin transactions, you need to provide specific details like terminal ID, merchant location, and ICC data. Once the cryptographic keys are securely added to the PED, the terminal is ready to confidently start transactions. Including these details carefully is crucial to ensure the safe and dependable processing of card transactions through the Nomba PTSP.

In conclusion, the connection to Nomba PTSP is achieved through a thorough process that includes Parameter Download, Key Exchange, and Card Transaction Initiation. Each of these steps plays a vital role in creating a secure and synchronized link between payment terminals and the Nomba system, promoting a dependable and streamlined environment for transaction processing.
